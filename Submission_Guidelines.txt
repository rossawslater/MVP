- at the end of the exam you should upload the code, any data and graphs/snapshots/other files you have

via learn, there will be a box on the course page where you will be able to do that; in case you cannot
do it for any reason there is no problem, you can alternatively just email me the files at
dmarendu@ph.ed.ac.uk or Davide.Marenduzzo@ed.ac.uk at the end of the exam 

- ideally you should upload/submit a single file, e.g. as a .tar, tar.gz or .zip; in case you do not know
how to do this, it is simple, please follow these instructions (to create a .tar or .tar.gz, i suggest
you give these commands a try before the day of the exam!):

  1. open a terminal in your home

  2. create a directory, for instance called MVPExam (mkdir MVPExam)

  3. move all the files which you want to submit into the directory MVPExam

  4. from the terminal you are in (where you have just created the MVPExam directory) type

      tar -cvf BXXX.tar MVPExam/*

      where XXX=your exam number (so i can match codes to scripts). this command creates a file called

      BXXX.tar where you store your director with all your files

  5. type

      gzip BXXX.tar

      this creates a (gzipped) file called BXXX.tar.gz which you can then submit (you can also submit the
      .tar file generated in step 4., it will just be a bit larger)
